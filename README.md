# ðŸš€ PERN Stack with Vite, Redux Toolkit, and Knex!

Supercharge your development with this comprehensive boilerplate designed for building applications using the PERN (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js) stack. This setup seamlessly integrates Vite for the frontend, Redux Toolkit for efficient state management, and Knex for seamless SQL queries, database migrations, and seed files. The server modules follow a structured and layered architecture.

## Project Structure

The project is thoughtfully organized into two distinct folders:

- **client:** Frontend code with the entry point located at `client/src/main.js`.
- **server:** Backend code with the main entry point at `server/src/server.js`.
